# CS50 Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through Harvard’s CS50 course.

I am taking CS50 to build strong fundamentals in computer science and programming.
This repository focuses on concepts learned, personal notes, and reflections.

No official CS50 problem set solutions are shared publicly, in accordance with
CS50’s academic honesty policy.
